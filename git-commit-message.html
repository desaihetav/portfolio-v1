        <h3 class="blog-subheading">Introduction to Git and Version Control</h3>
        <p class="blog-text">
          Version control is a tool which helps us keep track of changes that
          are made to our code. It tracks what changes were made, who made the
          changes and when were the changes made. Moreover, if we end up
          breaking some feature or the feature that we were trying to build
          doesn't work out, version control also facilitates us to move to the
          previous version of the code. Currently, Git is the most widely used
          version controlling tool.

          What are commit messages and why are they important?
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-text">
          A commit message is a description of what changes have been made in
          the current commit and why they were made. It is very important to
          write good commit messages as they can help you track the timeline of
          your projects. Commit messages become even more important when there
          are multiple people working on the same project, so that everyone
          understands what is going on with the project. Hence it is a good
          practice to write good commit messages and follow a common template
          that the team agrees upon. In case of a personal project, it is not
          compulsory to follow any such format or template but it is always
          advisable to use one, as it can be very much helpful if you decide to
          open source your project, share it with someone seeking for their help
          or showcase it on your portfolio. The practice of writing good commit
          messages also comes in handy when you want to go through code of some
          other developers or want to contribute to open source.

        <h3 class="blog-subheading">What is a good commit message?</h3>
        <p class="blog-text">
          A good commit message is a one which very clearly conveys the changes
          that were made in the commit and the reasons for the same. There are
          number of conventions and templated that are used across the industry.
          I'll highlight a few basic guidelines to follow which will help you
          write a good commit message.
        </p>
        <ol class="blog-list">
          <li>Mention the type of commit</li>
          <ul class="blog-list">
            <li>
              feat: The new feature you're adding to a particular application
            </li>
            <li>fix: A bug fix</li>
            <li>style: Feature and updates related to styling</li>
            <li>refactor: Refactoring a specific section of the codebase</li>
            <li>test: Everything related to testing</li>
            <li>docs: Everything related to documentation</li>
            <li>chore: Regular code maintenance</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Write your commit message in two parts: subject line and body</li>

          <li>Keep the subject line short and crisp</li>

          <li>
            In body, state what changes were made along with the reason for the
            same
          </li>

          <li>
            Provide necessary context when necessary (e.g., in case of bug fix,
            you could explain what the bug was)
          </li>

          <li>
            Follow the commit convention that is being followed by your team
            (and adapt the existing convention in case of open source
            contribution)
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="blog-subheading">Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p class="blog-text">
          The main idea of writing good commit messages is that it should be
          crisp, meaningful and convey the message well to anyone reading it.
          Writing good commit message is a skill that can be acquired overtime.
          You can refer to commit messages by good developers or on some of the
          top open source repos on GitHub.
